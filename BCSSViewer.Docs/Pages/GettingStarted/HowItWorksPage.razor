    <MudStack Spacing="4">
        <MudText>BCSS works through two basic and key parts: BlazorCssProvider and BcssService.</MudText>
        <MudText>
            BlazorCssProvider is a blazor component. The component automatically converts the BCSS class names passed to it into css styles.
            Works on the principle of set-it-and-forget-it component.
            It is placed in App.razor in the root layer of the application and initial values ​​are determined.
            Once in place, no referencing or modification required.
        </MudText>
        <MudText>
            BcssService is a classic service that can be used with Dependency Injection (DI).
            This service communicates with the Blazor CSS Provider component, controls it and performs all optimization operations.
            Unlike the BlazorCssProvider component, it can be injected on multiple pages or layouts.
            Operations such as cleaning, updating and configuring can be called manually by this service.
